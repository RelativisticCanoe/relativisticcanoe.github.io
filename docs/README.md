Here is a varied assortment of the best projects I completed over the course of my MPhys Physics with Astrophysics degree.

These are the works that I feel best represent my abilities:
- Numerical Simulations of Spring Systems: A 2nd year project on simulating damped Simple Harmonic Oscillators using numerical integration in Python.
- Optical Trapping using Laser Tweezers: A 3rd year report on a laboratory experiment about trapping micron-scale particles using optical tweezers.
- Matrix Class: An implementation of mathematical matrices in C++ as part of a 3rd year object-oriented programming module.
- Celestial Object Catalogue: A C++ program to catalogue celestial objects, submitted as a final assignment for the module mentioned above.
- Optical Simulations of Cherenkov Radiation: The first report for my final-year MPhys project.

All of these projects can be cloned from my GitHub repo or downloaded as a .zip folder for your consideration.
